# Deep-Learning-9-ArcFace-Multi-Class-Classification

This project deals with the ArcFace loss function. The idea is to change the similarity measure from a Euclidean distance (L2 Norm) to a Cosine distance. Cosine distance is somewhat invariant to partial noise
in the data (especially in high dimensional cases.

The program will be used to classify the MNIST and CIFAR10 files using the arc face loss function. 
The graphs would update as the model became more and more refined as the training was happeneing.
